This is a shell helper program to run things for certain time.  The
first invocation creates an empty reference file in /tmp, all future
invocations then check the file inode change time and if the time is
reached the file is removed and false is returned.

Following command outputs dots for 15 seconds without delay:
<pre>while runningfor 15; do echo -n .; done</pre>
